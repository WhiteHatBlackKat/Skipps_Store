    <article class="artist">
   <p>Self taught artist and photographer, born in 1994 skipp is my nickname given to me by my mom. I was a happy joyful little girl ( still am but a little older now) so she called me skipp and still does to this day. Photography and art are my passions. I started photography at young age when I got my first film camera in 6th grade it was pink and I took pitchers of my schools sock hop. I loved the idea of having a physical memory's of the past to go back and looked at. When digital cameras came into play I got a little red one and learned how to edit photos on photo shop. My other passion art has been around just as long if I was not taking pictures I was doodling on school work or even using the painting tool on our old family computer. Today I have upgraded to a Samsung galaxy s8 ultra tablet for digital art ( but still do pencil to paper art now and then) I add collections and galleries often so there will be plenty of pieces to look though, so make sure you come back to not miss out on new drops!<p>
